Data Valuation Techniques, Financial Perspective, "Techniques, and its derived metrics and KPIs, that help to assess the worth of data assets.", "Techniques, and its derived metrics and KPIs, that help to assess the worth of data assets. These techniques could be varied and thus their metrics and KPIs can be directly linked to them. Independently, they can help determine potential revenue-generating opportunities, calculate cost savings, define the relative value of data, and understand the economic impact of it. Given their relative impact, they can help to define KPIs and metrics for Data Monetization (next subcluster). Nevertheless, the following one focuses on pricing and economic benefits only (i.e. value ≠ price )."
Data Monetization, Financial Perspective, "KPIs and metrics that provide measurable evidence of the financial benefits derived from data initiatives.", "KPIs and metrics that provide measurable evidence of the financial benefits derived from data initiatives. These metrics track the revenue generated through data-driven products or services, calculate cost reductions from improved decision-making, and gauge the return on investment (ROI) from data-focused projects."
Customer Needs and Satisfaction, Customer Perspective, "KPIs and metrics used to evaluate the alignement of data products with customer needs and expectations.", "Evaluate the alignment of data products or insights with customer needs and expectations. These indicators include customer retention, engagement, and/or satisfaction tied to data-related services. "
Market Penetration, Customer Perspective, "KPIs and metrics indicating the extent of target market penetration of data solutions.", "Indicators that assess the extent to which data solutions have penetrated target markets, measuring factors such as market share growth and the adoption rates of new data products. These KPIs allow companies to gauge the reach and impact of their data monetization strategies within the market, ensuring that these initiatives are effectively attracting and retaining customers."
Data Quality, Internal Processes Perspective, "KPIs and metrics indicating the overall quality of datasets.", "Indicators that measure the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and other quality-related measures/indicators of data. High-quality data is essential for dependable insights and sound decision-making, serving as the backbone of successful data monetization efforts. By ensuring that data meets high standards of quality, organizations can generate more accurate analyses and insights, impacting the reliability of monetization outcomes. "
Data Governance and Compliance, Internal Processes Perspective, "Metrics and KPIs monitoring adherence to data governance principles and regulatory standards.", "Indicators that monitor adherence to data governance principles and regulatory standards, such as data privacy and security requirements.
