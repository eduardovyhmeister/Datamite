Data-as-a-Service,"Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) is a prominent data-driven business model where a central organization, often via a digital platform like Facebook or LinkedIn, gathers and offers anonymized raw data for commercial purposes through a marketplace. Users, such as developers or solution providers, utilize these datasets to enhance their offerings or explore new market opportunities. Successful implementation requires robust data collection capabilities, a trusted platform, and effective anonymization procedures. Revenue is typically generated through pay-per-data or subscription models. While attractive for companies with significant data volume and market dominance, only a few, like Amazon and Google, have managed to profitably sustain this model, with many past attempts by others failing. "
Information-as-a-Service,"The Insights-as-a-Service (IaaS) business model centers on providing analyses or reports rather than raw data. These analyses are customized to meet specific customer needs and can be derived from either internally collected data pools, augmenting the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) model, or external data sources. A diverse range of customers, from businesses to end consumers, can benefit from these insights, primarily aimed at making informed decisions. Successful implementation requires not only raw data but also analytical and visualization capabilities, coupled with industry expertise. Revenue generation within the IaaS model typically mirrors that of DaaS, encompassing sales of individual analyses or subscription-based access. Costs primarily stem from data acquisition, processing, and analysis creation, yet structured analyses often command higher prices due to their depth and specificity. IaaS models are particularly appealing to companies with robust analytical capabilities or those seeking to develop them strategically."
Answers-as-a-Service,"Answers-as-a-Service (AaaS) provides direct responses to user queries, enhancing decision-making. It often generates additional revenue streams through consulting or support services, appealing to both consumers and businesses in need of tailored guidance. Companies offering AaaS require not only data but also a profound understanding of user needs and market dynamics. Trust in data provision is essential for its success, while revenue models typically involve pay-per-answer or subscriptions, with higher prices for tailored responses. AaaS suits companies with strong customer relationships and industry knowledge. Challenges include identifying critical questions and determining the value of provided answers, but scalability and additional revenue opportunities through consulting or support services enhance its appeal. "
Reduce-cost,"By employing criteria-based data valuation, companies can identify valuable datasets and optimize their utilization. This involves assessing factors like data quality, relevance, and timeliness, allowing for informed decision-making regarding data acquisition and storage. Cost-based data valuation further enhances understanding by quantifying data-related expenses, including collection, storage, preprocessing, and maintenance costs. Through this, companies can allocate resources more efficiently and plan for future data monetization opportunities. Reporting-based data valuation extends this by integrating data reporting into annual financial statements, akin to sustainability reporting. Finally, transaction-based data valuation enables direct data monetization through sales or marketplace trading, leveraging new business models like as-a-Service or subscription-based models.  "
Data Network,"In data-driven business models, a robust data network facilitates collaboration among market players, driving value creation for companies. It involves integrating internal databases to break down silos and streamline data access across departments. Additionally, integration with suppliers enhances supply chain coordination and efficiency through technologies like electronic data interchange. Customer integration is crucial, with active participation in value creation through data provision. Partnerships with market counterparts of equal or superior value extend collaboration beyond data integration, fostering long-term cooperation for joint value creation and innovation. "
Data Wrapping,"In the context of data monetization, ""wrapping"" refers to the practice of enhancing core products or services by incorporating additional information or data-related features. This involves providing supplementary information or insights that add value to the core offering and make it more appealing to customers. For example, United Parcel Service (UPS) enhances its package delivery service by providing detailed information about the package's journey, delivery status, estimated arrival time, and other relevant data points. By offering this additional information, UPS not only improves the customer experience but also adds value to its core delivery service. Similarly, in other industries such as retail, wrapping can involve providing customers with additional data or insights related to the products or services they purchase. For instance, retailers may offer demographic sales reports, industry benchmark metrics, or analytics software to help customers optimize their marketing, pricing, or distribution strategies. "
Servitization,"In the framework of data-driven business models, servitization plays a pivotal role in enhancing value creation and revenue generation. It involves integrating services into traditional product offerings, leading to a shift from a pure product-centric model to a product-service hybrid model. This integration generates new opportunities for manufacturers by leveraging the data generated during the provision of services. The integration of servitization and Big Data frameworks enables manufacturers to extract valuable insights from data collected throughout the service lifecycle. This data-driven approach enhances decision-making processes, optimizes business operations, and ultimately increases profitability. "
Data Bartering,"Data bartering involves companies exchanging data for valuable assets, such as other data, insights, tools, or services. For instance, data and analytics providers may offer discounts based on contributions to their database, or directly exchange data with business partners, particularly in finance. In the retail industry, data bartering often involves trading point-of-sale data for demographic information or analytics software. The economic benefits of data bartering include the exchanged value in the form of tools, services, or data. "
Share-for-free,"A strategy to attract users and build a community is offering services free of charge, sometimes referred to as a freemium model. In this model, businesses provide basic data or services for free to encourage user engagement, while charging a premium for access to more detailed or advanced features. Popular examples include music and movie streaming platforms like YouTube, Spotify, Alexa, and Hulu music, which offer a wide range of content to attract a large user base, while reserving certain features or content for premium subscribers. Free content can add value by driving more traffic to the product or service enabling extensive data generation of users and thus for gaining a competitive advantage e.g. for non-free products or services. "
Data Platform Operator,"The platform operator facilitates the matching of supply and demand in manufacturing through transaction and innovation platforms. Transaction platforms connect buyers and sellers, exemplified by Airbnb and tapio. Innovation platforms, like Microsoft Azure, provide tools for customers to develop innovations. Platform operators offer standardized services while customers provide customized services to their end users. Success hinges on achieving critical mass, either through direct platform users or individual customers. Revenue primarily comes from transaction costs paid by platform users, but platform operators may also trade their own data or services. Consortia among competitors are common, pooling assets to achieve necessary data density. Platforms targeting individual customers show promise due to their alignment with existing products and established customer bases. "
Data Platform Refiner,"The Platform Enhancer, a derivative of the Platform Operator, utilizes data and transaction insights from its platform to create added value for its customers. While it shares similarities with the Platform Operator, the Enhancer's services are more tailored to individual customer needs, requiring the same level of data density. The value provided depends on the accessibility of data. Typically, greater access to customer processes and products necessitates a higher level of trust to access the data. In practice, manufacturing companies in the B2B sector often allow only selective data access, with data ownership remaining with the customer. These services include pre-built analysis tools for data and text mining, or pre-trained neural networks for video and image analysis. "
New Product / Services,"Companies often employ a strategy of creating entirely new offerings for customers based on data insights. These offerings may include new products and services that are either fueled by data or entirely devised from insights gleaned from data analysis. For example, IBM developed a service centered around sensors installed in the homes of elderly individuals to monitor vital signs and daily activities. By leveraging this data, anomalies can be identified, and relevant services can be alerted, leading to potential cost savings of up to 30 percent. Other companies utilize data to innovate services that complement their core offerings, as seen with Netflix and DHL. This approach is particularly evident in industries like product maintenance, with companies such as Siemens, Thyssenkrupp, and Pirelli. The economic benefits of this strategy include the creation of new revenue streams and the exploration of new business segments. "
