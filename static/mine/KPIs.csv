However, achieving this understanding is often a hurdle, contingent upon the data consumer?s (i.e., data Buyer) grasp of the vocabulary and metadata from the data provider (i.e., data Seller). This necessitates the accessibility of metadata to decode the data content, adhering to the FAIR principles, and the utilization of a common vocabulary. In instances where a common vocabulary is absent, a mapping between the vocabularies of the data consumer and provider is imperative. Furthermore, this consider the following of standards, in case of existance, for data representation and its taxonomy.",CUSTOMER
